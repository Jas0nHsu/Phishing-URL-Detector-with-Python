Step 1: Create an account in VirusTotal and obtain your API key.

Go to the VirusTotal website and sign up for an account.
Retrieve your API key from the account settings.

Step 2: Insert the API key into our Python code.

Open the Python code and locate the designated area for the API key.
Replace 'Your_Key' with your actual API key, using the format VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = 'Your_Key'.

Step 3: Install the required modules.

Ensure that you have the tkinter, requests, json, and webbrowser modules installed.
If not, install them using the appropriate package manager or command.

Step 4: Execute the code and run the script.

Run the Python script containing the Phishing Guard Detector code.
This will create a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library.

Step 5: Test a link for phishing.

Enter any link you want to test in the provided input field.
Click the appropriate button to initiate the scanning process.

Step 6: Check the results.

If the URL is not a phishing link, the scanner box will display a description in green, indicating that the link is safe.
If the URL is identified as a phishing link, the scanner box will provide a warning or alert.
